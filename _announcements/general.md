Welcome to Berkeley and welcome to Data 6! On behalf of the Data 6 course staff, we’re excited to be teaching you this summer and hope you enjoy this class as much as we enjoy teaching it. 

Our class starts on Monday (7/1) at 10:00 AM in [SOCS](https://www.berkeley.edu/map/social-sciences-building/) 110. Before we start next week, there are a few logistical things we want to go over:

* All course materials, including the ‘textbook’ and assignments, will be hosted on our **[course website](https://data6.org/su24/)**. This website will serve as a ‘home base’ for the course, since we do not use bCourses (Canvas). We recommend bookmarking the website for easy access.
* For all class communications we will use **[Ed Discussion](https://edstem.org/us/courses/60192/discussion/)** (or “Ed”, as we’ll refer to it). You can think about Ed as “24/7 office hours” — you can post questions about concepts or assignments and get help from course staff and other students.
* For homeworks and quizzes we will use **[Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/800533)**. Make sure you can access both Gradescope and Ed — if you can’t, email Atticus (atticus.ginsborg@berkeley.edu) and Edwin (jedwin321@berkeley.edu) and we will add you.
* Finally, please fill out this **[welcome survey](https://forms.gle/xnsdLifJwTCU19kw9)** before the first day of class so we can get to know a little bit more about you and how we can best support you in the class.

Other than filling out the welcome survey, there's nothing else you need to do to prepare before the first day of class. But if you'd like, you can read more about Data 6, the syllabus, and important course policies at [data6.org/su24](https://data6.org/su24/syllabus/).

Again, welcome to Data 6 — we can’t wait to meet you and are super excited to be teaching you this summer!

Best,
[Atticus](https://data6.org/su24/staff/#instructors) and [Edwin](https://data6.org/su24/staff/#instructors)
