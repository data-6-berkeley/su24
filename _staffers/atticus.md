bio: Hi, my name is Jonathan, I'm a rising Senior majoring in Data Sci, Cog Sci, and Psych, with a minor in CS. When I'm not teaching or in class, you can usually find me at a cafe around campus, playing video games with friends, or out at a nearby trail hiking! I love to travel; a fun fact about me is that iâ€™ve been to 47 states and 2/3 of the national parks! This is my first time teaching Data 6, though I have previously taught for other courses such as Data 8 and CS 61A. Feel free to reach out anytime, I'm happy to talk about anything, whether it is course related, career or academic related, or anything else! :)
