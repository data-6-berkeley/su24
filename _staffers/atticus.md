bio: Hi everyone! I'm originally from the Bay Area and have loved my past four years here at Berkeley where I recently graduated with degrees in Data Science and Economics. In the Fall I'll be attending UChicago to pursue a Masters in Data Science. Outside of school I love watching and playing all sports (especially chess), reading, and going on hikes in the Berkeley hills. This is my first time teaching Data 6 after 7 semesters with Data 8. Feel free to reach out anytime and I'm so excited to teach Data 6 this summer!
